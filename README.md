# FullStack_Mongo

### Overview
In this full-stack project, I built a news-scraper application that allows users to scrape for new articles from the New York Times website and see the title and summary of each one of them. Besides that, the user can save each article that seems interesting for them to store in another page to see later and add some comments to the saved articles.

All data in this project are beeing stored using the `database MongoDB`. 

This application is deployed in Heroku and you can check it out here -> https://fathomless-hollows-59057.herokuapp.com/

### Node.js

If you want to run this application locally, you can clone the repository with this link https://github.com/rickpicolli/FullStack_Mongo.git , install the NPM modules using `npm install` in your terminal, start the MongoDB and the server, and try it.

in order to run the database, you need to open 2(two) different Terminals and run in the first one the command:
- `mongod`

and in the second one the command:

- `mongo`

After doing this you can running the file:
- `server.js`

  - You should see a message saying the app is listening the port 3000, which means that you are good to open the page in your brownser (preferably, Chrome) using  `localhost:3000` as a url.
